# Enterprise Systems Architecture & Business Process Optimization

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project, completed as part of the **Master of Information Technology at UOW (Graduated with Distinction)**, focuses on designing and optimizing a complex service-oriented ecosystem. It demonstrates the full lifecycle of systems analysis—from service identification and **Enterprise Architecture (EA)** design to **BPMN 2.0** workflow modeling and system performance optimization.

**Grade Achieved:** High Distinction (HD)

## 🛠️ Key Responsibilities & Achievements

### 1. Business Process Modeling (BPMN 2.0)
* Designed end-to-end business process models for multi-stakeholder services (Tour/Room Booking, Route Planning).
* Utilized **BPMN 2.0** to ensure logical consistency between user interactions and back-end microservices.
* Conducted process analysis to identify and eliminate operational redundancies.

### 2. Enterprise Architecture (EA) Design
* Developed a comprehensive **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** to integrate diverse service providers (Accommodation, Transportation, Activity Centers).
* Mapped data flows and service dependencies to ensure system scalability and reliability.

### 3. System Integration & Optimization
* **Bottleneck Analysis:** Analyzed system performance from the user interaction layer down to technical implementation.
* **Payment Integration:** Proposed optimization strategies for **third-party payment gateway interfaces**, including multithreading to reduce latency.
* **Database Optimization:** Designed indexing strategies for high-frequency queries (Order/Customer IDs) and caching mechanisms to handle high-concurrency scenarios.

## 📊 Technical Stack
* **Modeling:** BPMN 2.0, Enterprise Architecture (EA) Frameworks
* **Analysis:** System Integration Analysis, Performance Bottleneck Identification
* **Tools:** Visual Paradigm / Lucidchart, SQL (Query Optimization), API Documentation

## 📂 Project Structure
* `/Diagrams`: Exported BPMN 2.0 workflows and Architecture Diagrams.
* `/Report`: The comprehensive 160+ page systems analysis report (PDF).
